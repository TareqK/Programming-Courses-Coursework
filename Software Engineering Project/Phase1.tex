\section{Introduction}
\subsection{State of the Customer}
The Customer is a Hospital, and currently, is completely dependent on a pen-and-paper process to perform all of its management. Our goal
is to transfer this process to an electronic one and streamline it, further adding features that allow the patient to be more 
directly involved in their treatment process. 
\subsection{Current Problems}
As stated above, the customer is still using a paper process for management. Due to the large number of patients and doctors, this 
has become very cumbersome on the customer for the following reasons:
\begin{enumerate}

	
	\item Breakdown in communication: Due to the fact that everything is being done by paper, sometimes the different departments
	do not get their message across clearly due to human errors in spelling or handwriting, leading to the need to repeat work.
	
	\item Theft: Due to the nature of the customer's business, no patient is turned away, and some are lying and claiming prescriptions
	and tests that were not written for them, costing the customer money, and due to the fact that the stock system is manual, the customer
	suspects that some things are taken out without permission. The customer would like to be able to control stocks better.
	
	\item Stocks: Due to the fact that there is no active change in stocks, the customer often finds themselves out of necessary items.
	
	\item Protocol and Chain of command: The customer has said that due to the high amount of personal interaction and the slow speed of the 
	current system, Protocols are being breached often and the Chain of command is not being adhered to in order to provide care in a 
	timely fashion. 
	
	\item Storage issues: Due to the large amounts of records they have, the customer is running out of physical space to store 
	records of their operation. This will lead them to either rent an archive space or to destroy old records.
	
	\item Pollution: Since the customer still uses paper, this paper will eventually have to be destroyed, which is currently 
	through burning. The customer has stated that they would like to be more environmentally-friendly and cut waste.

\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\subsubsection{User Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
